# Toohig-Data-Science-Portfolio  
## About the Semester Portfolio 📄
- Will include projects completed throughout my Introduction to Data Science class
- 3 projects total (1 completed)
- Utilizes exploratory and explanatory data analysis, different types of machine learning, and interactivity
- Displays learning growth and skill enhancement through knowledge gained in and out of class
## Purpose 🔍
The purpose of my Data Science Portfolio is to have a central location to display my projects. Whether for personal research or future career recruitment, a local portfolio to see not only my projects but their code and programming process will give a detailed exhibition of my knowledge, interests, and skills. More of my personality will be displayed in my projects and problem-solving processes. It acts as a live resume for the complexities behind my code, data cleansing skills, and past and recent activity progression. The timeline of projects posted will show my growth and learning achievements, further allowing myself to stand out in the professional field. 
## Organization 🗂️
I plan to organize my portfolio by creating folders for each project. Within each project folder, there will be associated folders where more grouping is necessary (visualizations, EDA, models, code), and other relevant files used in each project.
