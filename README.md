# Toohig-Data-Science-Portfolio 
## Purpose 🔍
The purpose of my Data Science Portfolio is to have a central location to display my Data Science related projects. Whether for personal reasearch or future career recruitment, a local portfolio to see not only my projects but thier code and programming process will give a detailed exhibition of my knowledge, interests, and skills. More of my personalality will be displayed in my projects and problem-solving processes. It acts as a live resume for the complexities behind my code, data cleansing skills, and past and recent activity progression. The timeline of projects posted will show my growth and learning achievements, further allowing myself to stand out in the professional field.  
## Organizaton 🗂️
I plan to organize my Porfolio by creating folders for each project. Withing each project folders, there will be associated folders where more grouping is necessary (visualizations, EDA, code), and other files that may have been used.
